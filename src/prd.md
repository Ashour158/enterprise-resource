## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity

**Emotional Response**: The design should evoke trust, efficiency, and technological sophistication. Users should feel confident managing critical business data.

**Design Personality**: Professional, modern, and systematic. The interface should feel like a premium enterprise tool while remaining approachable.

**Visual Metaphors**: 
- Connection indicators (WiFi-style icons) for sync status
- Progress bars for real-time synchronization
- Color-coded status indicators for data health
- Card-based layouts representing business modules

**Simplicity Spectrum**: Rich interface that balances information density with clarity. Multiple data points need to be visible simultaneously without overwhelming the user.

### Color Strategy

**Color Scheme Type**: Triadic with primary blue, complementary orange accents, and success green

**Primary Color**: Deep blue (oklch(0.45 0.15 240)) - conveys trust, stability, and professionalism
**Secondary Colors**: Light warm gray (oklch(0.92 0.08 60)) - provides neutral background for data
**Accent Color**: Vibrant orange (oklch(0.70 0.20 50)) - draws attention to important actions and alerts

**Color Psychology**: 
- Blue establishes trust and reliability for financial data
- Orange creates urgency for alerts and conflicts
- Green confirms successful operations and sync status
- Gray provides calm background for complex interfaces

**Foreground/Background Pairings**:
- Background (white): Foreground (dark blue) - 15.2:1 ratio
- Card (light gray): Foreground (dark blue) - 14.8:1 ratio
- Primary (blue): Foreground (white) - 9.8:1 ratio
- Accent (orange): Foreground (white) - 7.2:1 ratio

### Typography System

**Font Pairing Strategy**: Single font family (Inter) with multiple weights for consistency and clarity
**Primary Font**: Inter - chosen for excellent readability at small sizes and professional appearance
**Monospace Font**: JetBrains Mono - for technical data, IDs, and code-like content

**Typographic Hierarchy**:
- H1 (Dashboard titles): 2rem, font-bold
- H2 (Card titles): 1.25rem, font-semibold  
- H3 (Section headers): 1rem, font-medium
- Body text: 0.875rem, font-normal
- Small text/labels: 0.75rem, font-normal
