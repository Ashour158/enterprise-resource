# ERP System - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Enhancement

## Core Purpose & Success
- **Mission Statement**: Implement a comprehensive 5-tier role-based access control system with multi-company isolation, ensuring secure and granular permissions management across all ERP modules.
- **Success Indicators**: Zero unauthorized data access incidents, seamless role transitions, 100% company data isolation, and intuitive permission management for administrators.
- **Experience Qualities**: Secure, Intuitive, Granular

## Project Classification & Approach
- **Complexity Level**: Complex Application (advanced functionality with multi-tenant security)
- **Primary User Activity**: Interacting (role management, permission configuration, security monitoring)

## Thought Process for Feature Selection
- **Core Problem Analysis**: Enterprise systems need granular access control with company isolation and hierarchical role management
- **User Context**: System administrators and company admins need to manage user permissions while maintaining strict security boundaries
- **Critical Path**: Role definition → User assignment → Permission verification → Audit trail
- **Key Moments**: Role assignment, permission escalation requests, cross-company access attempts

## Essential Features

### 5-Tier Role Hierarchy System
- **Super Admin (Level 1)**: Global system access across all companies and modules
- **Company Admin (Level 2)**: Full company-specific access with user management capabilities
- **Manager (Level 3)**: Department/team level access with approval workflows
- **User (Level 4)**: Standard operational access to assigned modules and data
- **Viewer (Level 5)**: Read-only access with limited export capabilities

### Permission Matrix Management
- **Module-based Permissions**: Granular CRUD permissions for each ERP module
- **Data Scope Control**: Company, department, team, and individual data access boundaries
- **Dynamic Permission Assignment**: Role-based and individual permission overrides
- **Permission Inheritance**: Hierarchical permission cascading with explicit overrides

### Advanced Permission Inheritance & Role Hierarchies
- **Role Hierarchy Definition**: Multi-level organizational structure with parent-child relationships
- **Permission Inheritance Flows**: Automated cascading of permissions from parent to child roles
- **Inheritance Conflict Resolution**: Intelligent detection and resolution of permission contradictions
- **Permission Delegation**: Temporary permission grants with time limits and revocation capabilities
- **Effective Permissions Calculation**: Real-time computation of cumulative permissions from all sources
- **Inheritance Validation**: Automated detection of circular dependencies and excessive inheritance depth

### Security & Audit Framework
- **Real-time Permission Validation**: Every action verified against current permissions
- **Audit Trail System**: Comprehensive logging of all permission changes and access attempts
- **Security Monitoring**: Anomaly detection and unauthorized access prevention
- **Compliance Reporting**: GDPR, HIPAA, and SOX compliance tracking

## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
- **Emotional Response**: Professional confidence and security assurance
- **Design Personality**: Enterprise-grade, systematic, and authoritative
- **Visual Metaphors**: Shield iconography, hierarchical structures, access gates
- **Simplicity Spectrum**: Rich interface with clear hierarchical organization

### Color Strategy
- **Color Scheme Type**: Custom palette with security-focused semantics
- **Primary Color**: Deep blue (oklch(0.45 0.15 240)) - trust and security
- **Secondary Colors**: Neutral grays for structure and organization
- **Accent Color**: Amber (oklch(0.70 0.20 50)) for warnings and attention
- **Security Status Colors**: Green (approved), red (denied), yellow (pending)
- **Color Accessibility**: WCAG AA compliant with 4.5:1 contrast ratios

### Typography System
- **Font Pairing Strategy**: Inter for UI, JetBrains Mono for technical data
- **Typographic Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between role levels and permission types
- **Font Personality**: Professional, readable, and systematic
- **Which fonts**: Inter (primary), JetBrains Mono (code/IDs)

### UI Elements & Component Selection
- **Permission Matrix**: Table components with clear CRUD indicators
- **Role Cards**: Card components showing role hierarchy and capabilities
- **Access Trees**: Expandable tree components for permission inheritance
- **Security Badges**: Status indicators for permission levels and security states
- **Audit Panels**: Timeline components for security events and changes

### Animations
- **Permission Changes**: Subtle transitions when permissions are modified
- **Security Alerts**: Attention-grabbing animations for security events
- **Role Transitions**: Smooth animations when switching between role views

## Implementation Considerations
- **Multi-company Data Isolation**: Strict tenant separation with context validation
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient permission caching and validation
- **Scalability**: Support for thousands of users across hundreds of companies
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with existing ERP modules and authentication

## Reflection
This RBAC system provides enterprise-grade security while maintaining usability through clear visual hierarchy and intuitive permission management interfaces. The 5-tier system balances granular control with operational efficiency.
