- **Session Management**: Company-aware sessions with device tracking
- **Security Monitoring**: Real-time threat detection and audit logging

### API Architecture
- **RESTful Design**: Consistent, predictable endpoint structure
- **GraphQL Integration**: Flexible data querying for complex relationships
- **WebSocket Support**: Real-time updates and notifications
- **Rate Limiting**: Company-aware throttling and quota management
- **API Versioning**: Backward compatibility and smooth migrations

### Data Management
- **Multi-Tenant Database**: Company-isolated data with shared infrastructure
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Reliable cross-module communication
- **Conflict Resolution**: Intelligent merge strategies for concurrent updates
- **Audit Trails**: Comprehensive logging for compliance and forensics

## Design Direction

### API Response Format
```json
{
  "success": boolean,
  "data": object | array,
  "meta": {
    "timestamp": "ISO 8601",
    "request_id": "uuid",
    "company_id": "string",
    "user_id": "string",
    "api_version": "string"
  },
  "pagination": {
    "page": number,
    "limit": number,
    "total": number,
    "has_next": boolean
  },
  "errors": [
    {
      "code": "string",
      "message": "string",
      "field": "string",
      "context": object
    }
  ]
}
```

### Authentication Flow
1. **Initial Login**: POST /api/v1/auth/login → Returns user profile + company list
2. **Company Selection**: POST /api/v1/auth/select-company → Returns company-scoped JWT
3. **Token Refresh**: POST /api/v1/auth/refresh → Validates and refreshes tokens
4. **Company Switching**: POST /api/v1/auth/switch-company → Seamless company transition
5. **Secure Logout**: POST /api/v1/auth/logout → Invalidates all tokens

### Security Architecture
- **End-to-End Encryption**: AES-256-GCM for data at rest, TLS 1.3 for transit
- **Company Data Isolation**: Row-level security with company_id filtering
- **API Key Management**: Rotating keys with usage analytics
- **Compliance Framework**: GDPR, HIPAA, SOX, and industry-specific standards

## Implementation Considerations

### Scalability Needs
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Microservices architecture with container orchestration
- **Database Sharding**: Company-aware data distribution
- **Caching Strategy**: Redis clusters for session and frequently accessed data
- **CDN Integration**: Global content delivery for static assets

### Performance Optimization
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient database connection management
- **Query Optimization**: Indexed searches with company context
- **Background Processing**: Celery workers for heavy operations
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket connections with automatic failover

### Monitoring & Observability
- **Health Checks**: Comprehensive endpoint monitoring
- **Performance Metrics**: Response times, throughput, and error rates
- **Security Monitoring**: Anomaly detection and threat intelligence
- **Business Metrics**: User engagement and feature adoption
