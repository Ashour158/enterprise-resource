## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
**Emotional Response**: Professional confidence, analytical clarity, data-driven precision
**Design Personality**: Clean, sophisticated, enterprise-grade with subtle data-focused aesthetics
**Visual Metaphors**: Grid systems, layered information architecture, progressive disclosure
**Simplicity Spectrum**: Clean interface with rich functionality - minimal cognitive load

### Color Strategy
**Color Scheme Type**: Professional data palette with semantic color coding
**Primary Color**: Deep blue (oklch(0.45 0.15 240)) - trust and reliability
**Secondary Colors**: 
- Success green (oklch(0.60 0.20 130)) for positive metrics
- Warning amber (oklch(0.70 0.15 60)) for attention items
- Error red (oklch(0.60 0.22 25)) for negative indicators
**Accent Color**: Bright orange (oklch(0.70 0.20 50)) for interactive elements and highlights
**Color Psychology**: Blues convey trust and stability, green indicates positive performance, red signals issues requiring attention
**Color Accessibility**: All color combinations meet WCAG AA standards (4.5:1 contrast ratio)
**Foreground/Background Pairings**:
- Primary text on background: oklch(0.25 0.10 240) on oklch(1 0 0) - 16.4:1 ratio
- Card text on card background: oklch(0.25 0.10 240) on oklch(0.98 0 0) - 15.1:1 ratio
- Primary button text: oklch(1 0 0) on oklch(0.45 0.15 240) - 9.7:1 ratio

### Typography System
**Font Pairing Strategy**: Inter for UI text, JetBrains Mono for data/numbers
**Typographic Hierarchy**: Bold headers (700), medium labels (500), regular body (400)
**Font Personality**: Clean, legible, professional with excellent number distinction
**Readability Focus**: Generous line height (1.5), optimal reading width, clear size relationships
**Typography Consistency**: Consistent scale (1.25 ratio), aligned baseline grid
**Which fonts**: Inter (primary), JetBrains Mono (data/code)
**Legibility Check**: Excellent legibility tested across devices and zoom levels

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
**Attention Direction**: Progressive disclosure from overview to detail, guided visual flow
**White Space Philosophy**: Generous spacing to reduce cognitive load and highlight data
**Grid System**: 12-column responsive grid with consistent gutters
**Responsive Approach**: Mobile-first with adaptive chart scaling and layout reflow
**Content Density**: Balanced information density with breathing room

### Animations
**Purposeful Meaning**: Smooth transitions convey data relationships and state changes
**Hierarchy of Movement**: Subtle chart animations (300ms), state transitions (200ms), micro-interactions (150ms)
**Contextual Appropriateness**: Professional, subtle animations that enhance rather than distract

### UI Elements & Component Selection
**Component Usage**: Cards for data groupings, Tabs for view switching, Dialogs for drill-down details
**Component Customization**: Custom chart containers with consistent spacing and borders
**Component States**: Clear loading states, error handling, and empty data scenarios
**Icon Selection**: Phosphor icons for consistency with existing ERP system
**Component Hierarchy**: Primary actions (solid buttons), secondary (outline), tertiary (ghost)
**Spacing System**: 4px base unit with consistent padding and margins
**Mobile Adaptation**: Responsive charts with touch-optimized interactions

### Visual Consistency Framework
**Design System Approach**: Component-based design extending existing ERP patterns
**Style Guide Elements**: Consistent color usage, typography scale, spacing rhythm
**Visual Rhythm**: Regular patterns in layout, consistent visual weight distribution
**Brand Alignment**: Professional enterprise aesthetic matching ERP system identity

### Accessibility & Readability
